# Throw Away

> notes by Brian Fortuin

The line above is equivalent to an  '<h1>Throw Away</h1>' HTML markup.

The idea of  markdown files is to make it easier to write text that you want to have some sort of **richeness** to it, but dont want to get hung up on the details of markup (HTML) or having to resort to more 'binary representation such as in MS Word.

Markdown can produce lists just like this:

-A List item can either start with a dash or an asterix
	-its a good idea to be consistent
	- This line and the one aboe are indented in the lists
-undordered lists are easy to do in markdown.
- Besides unordered lists, you can do ordered lists. For and ordered list, use the number 1 followed by a dot (as seen below).

## Other examples

THe line above is equivalent to an <h2> element. (Note 2 pound symbols - you can have up to six!)
